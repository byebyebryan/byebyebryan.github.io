# Down But Not Out

Yesterday was what you call a not so good day for me.

Long story short is that I've applied for two of the top tech companies in my area and I found out yesterday that I've been rejected by both of them. Rejected in the sense of didn't get past the resume screen even with inside referrals.

That was unfortunate, and to be honest, a bit unexpected.



# Break Down the Invisible Wall

When you are aware of something but don't know enough about it, there is often this invisible wall that separate you from the truth. Then your imagination starts to fill in the blanks, and a lot of things starts to look worse than they really are. Before too long, you scared yourself away from even thinking about peek over the wall and take a look.

That's what happened to me before I started this journey.

I thought I've done my homework and prepared well. I've spent a lot of time working and reworking my resume. I've sent it to everyone I know that might help and they helped. But in the end I didn't get to set my foot in the door.



But I respectfully disagree.

I'm writing this down as a reminder to myself that there is nothing wrong with my story. Maybe there is something seriously wrong with the way I've been trying to tell my story, and I'm sincerely grateful for whoever that's pointing it out to me. I thought I've worked hard on getting everything ready but it is clear that was not good enough. Now I'll just work harder and push myself further out of my comfort zone.

I'm not gonna lie and the truth is that a big challenge just turned into a much bigger one. I do feel a bit overwhelmed and lost at the moment by I'm sure I will work things out one way or another. After all, facing challenges and solving problems are what programmers do, right?

Eyes up, game on.
