## About me

I'm a software engineer and have been doing it for over a decade. I wouldn't call myself an expert, but "veteran" probably fits.

Like everyone else, I write code to make things work and pay the bills. I'm fully aware of the saying "premature optimization is the root of all evil," and I don't disagree with the idea that we should build it fast, break it fast, and fix it later when needed.

But every now and then I get an itch in the back of my head: what if I deliberately over-engineer the hell out of it and see how far I can push the design?

To me, coding is more of a craft than a job. It's not just about getting things done; how it gets done matters too. The fun is in designing it properly, making it cleaner, more readable, and more performant—even if it means refactoring the same piece of code one more time just because it could be nicer.

## About this dev log

We live in an era where every day there’s a new AI coding tool that's supposedly going to make software engineers obsolete. It can feel like you don't need to know how to code at all, let alone care about proper design or skills.

My biggest problem with this trend of "vibe coding" is that most of the time it doesn't really work, and even when it does, it takes away all the fun.

I’d argue these new AI superpowers give us the perfect opportunity to dig even deeper into how things work underneath and how to get things done properly. We can do the actual thinking, make the design calls, and let AI handle the grunt work.

So this dev log is for exactly that: staying curious, trying ideas, taking things apart to see how they tick, and exploring how to build things properly—with some style while we're at it.

Some of it will reinvent wheels, some of it might actually be useful to someone out there, and hopefully we all learn something along the way.

Enough intro—next up, code.
