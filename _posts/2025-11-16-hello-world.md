## About me

I've been a software engineer for over a decade. I'm currently at Snap on the Bitmoji Rendering team. If you've used Bitmoji and seen it shift from 2D comics to 3D renders over the last few years, you've seen the system I spend most of my time on.

It's not some fancy AI product that's going to make the company the big bucks, but it gives me what I care about: lots of computer graphics and performance work. We render billions of images per day on GPU servers, so the code has to be tight and efficient.

That means a lot of highly optimized C++.

## About clean code

I'm one of the lucky few who genuinely enjoy their day job. A big reason is that I get to write C++.

I'm not here to argue that C++ is superior to everything else. I like it because it gives you low-level, explicit control you rarely get elsewhere, and that scratches an itch that other languages don't.

That low-level access also pushes you to think about design and cleaner code. You can't ignore memory, lifetime, and where your abstractions cost you.

To me, code is still a craft. It's not just about getting things done; how it gets done matters too. A lot of the fun is in making it cleaner, more readable, and more robust.

We all know the saying "premature optimization is the root of all evil" and shipping does matter. But sometimes I still want to lean into the design side and see how far we can push it.

## About the AI era

Every week there's a new AI coding tool that's supposedly going to make us obsolete. The pitch is often: write a prompt, let agents handle the rest, and don't worry about the details.

I've been there and done that. And don't get me wrong, I'm so used to the "AI workflow" now I can't imagine ever going back to hand-writing everything. In fact, I'm having GPT help me write this post right now.

The problem, in my eyes, is the trend of not caring about how things get done anymore. Anyone can tell AI what they want and call it done. AI might get things working, but a lot of that code goes straight into the tech-debt pile.

Instead, I'd rather focus even more on how we get things done: thinking about design, making code cleaner and more readable, and letting AI handle the grunt work.

## About this dev log

I've always been a bit of a neat freak about code. I've earned more than one "refactor guy" joke at work. But in a day job, there's only so much room for that; in the end, impact and velocity win.

This dev log is my space to lean into the craft side: exploring how to build things properly, with some style, and learning along the way.

I'm not claiming to be an expert. I'm just curious and want to try ideas, revisit half-finished projects, and clean up old experiments.

Some of it will reinvent wheels, some of it might be useful to someone else, and hopefully we all learn something from the process.

Enough intro—next up, code.
