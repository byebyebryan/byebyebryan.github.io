title: Booting up the dev log
description: Why this space exists and what I want to write about.

I spun up this log to document experiments in rendering, C++, and simulation
work. Expect bite-sized notes, shader snippets, and plenty of in-progress
thoughts rather than polished essays.

If you're curious about anything specific—graphics APIs, ECS tangents, physics
sketches—let me know. The plan is to treat this place as a working notebook,
and GitHub Pages plus Markdown makes that painless.
